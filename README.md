Geofencing technology uses GPS or RFID to generate a virtual circle around a specific geographical area. Once the boundary is established, activity can be kept in check within it. 

1.Social Media and Communication: Facebook: uses geofencing to target users based on their device location. Ads are shown to users who enter these geofenced areas, ensuring that the content is relevant to their current location. Advertisers can define geofenced areas within Facebook's Ad Manager by specifying locations or setting a radius around a point on the map. When a user enters a geofenced area, Facebook can trigger real-time ad delivery or notifications based on the predefined criteria set by the advertiser. 

2. Navigation and Travel: Uber: Uses geofencing to alert drivers when they enter or leave designated areas and to manage driver availability. Drivers receive notifications when they enter a high-demand area, encouraging them to position themselves where rides are more likely to be requested, and also inform about the areas where pick-ups are not allowed. Uber collects location data through GPS signals from drivers’ and passengers’ mobile devices. Uber continuously monitors these geofenced areas and can make real-time adjustments based on changing conditions such as traffic, demand, and safety issues.

3. Safety and Security: Life360: Uses geofencing to notify family members when someone arrives at or leaves a specific location. Users can create geofences for any custom locations like a friend’s house, a gym, or a frequent hangout spot. The app continuously monitors the location of family members in relation to the geofenced areas and sends real-time alerts based on predefined conditions.

4. Marketing and Advertising: Shopkick: Provides rewards and deals to users when they enter participating retail locations. Automatic Rewards: Shopkick sets up geofences around participating retail locations. When users with the app installed enter these geofenced areas, they automatically receive "kicks" (reward points) simply for visiting the store. Users receive additional kicks for walking into specific stores. This encourages users to visit physical retail locations, increasing foot traffic for retailers.
